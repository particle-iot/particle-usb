# particle-usb

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/particle-iot/particle-usb.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/particle-iot/particle-usb)

A library for accessing Particle USB devices.

**Note:** This library requires [Particle firmware](https://github.com/particle-iot/firmware) 0.8.0 or later.

## Installation

Using npm:

```sh
$ npm install particle-usb
```


## Usage

In Node.js:

```js
import * as usb from 'particle-usb';
```

### Enumerating devices

```js
const devices = await usb.getDevices();
for (let device of devices) {
  console.log(device.type); // Prints device type, e.g. "Photon"
}
```

### Opening devices

Most of the device methods, such as `reset()`, require the device to be open:

```js
const devices = await usb.getDevices();
if (devices.length == 0) {
  throw new Error('No devices found');
}
const device = devices[0];
await device.open();
await device.reset(); // Resets the device
```

It is possible to open a device by ID:

```js
const device = await usb.openDeviceById('0123456789abcdef01234567');
await device.reset();
```

The device should be closed when it is no longer needed:

```js
await device.close();
```

## Development

### Installing

1. Install Node.js [`node@12.x` and `npm@6.x` are required]
1. Clone this repository `$ git clone git@github.com:particle-iot/particle-usb.git && cd ./particle-usb`
1. Install dependencies `$ npm install`
1. View available commands `$ npm run`
1. Run the tests `$ npm test`
1. Start Hacking!


## Testing

Particle USB has a number of automated test suites and related commands. The most important are:

* `npm test` - run all tests
* `npm run lint` - run the linter and print any errors to your terminal
* `npm run coverage` - report code coverage stats

All tests use [mocha](https://mochajs.org), [chai](https://www.chaijs.com), and [sinon](https://sinonjs.org/) with coverage handled by [nyc](https://github.com/istanbuljs/nyc).

We recommend running locally if you can as it greatly shortens your feedback loop. However, CI also runs against every PR and [error reporting is publicly available](https://travis-ci.org/particle-iot/particle-usb).
